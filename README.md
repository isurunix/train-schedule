## FAQ

### This is already there. Why another one ?? 

* Yes, it's true that a web portal to view train schedule is already out there.  
But should it be a reason to not build another one?  
I wanted to explore NodeJS and template engines. So instead of just going through tutorial I felt like building this. :blush:
 
### ICTA API ?? How did you do that ?

* Shhh.. It's little secret. If you really wanna know drop me a msg.
