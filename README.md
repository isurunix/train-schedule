# Train Schedule - Sri Lanka

A simple way to view schedule of trains in Sri Lanka via web.  
This uses the publicly available train schedule provided by the ICTA API.
Live version hosted on heroku at [train-schedule-sl.herokuapp.com](https://train-schedule-sl.herokuapp.com/)

## FAQ

### This is already there. Why another one ?? 

* Yes, it's true that a web portal to view train schedule is already out there.  
But should it be a reason to not build another one?  
I wanted to explore NodeJS and template engines. So instead of just going through tutorial I felt like building this. :blush:
 
### ICTA API ??

* Well, it's a well know fact that ICTA have an API where we can get these schedule data. But the problem is that this API may not be readily available to the public. As the time of updating this README (03/18) you have to contact ICTA to get the API access configured.

* **Update**.
    * Seems ICTA API is no longer available and not public. Please refer to the discussion at https://github.com/isurunix/train-schedule/discussions/4
